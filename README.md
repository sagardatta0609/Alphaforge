### Smart Waste-to-Energy Hubs for Small Cities

AlphaForge is a sustainability-focused startup initiative aimed at transforming organic waste into clean energy, compost, and local employment opportunities for Tier-2 and Tier-3 cities in India.

This project presents a responsive landing page built using HTML and CSS to showcase the AlphaForge vision, solution, and revenue model.


## Vision

India generates over **62 million tonnes of waste annually**, much of it unmanaged in smaller cities.

AlphaForge aims to solve this by building:
